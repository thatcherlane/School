## library used to determine a if the users date of birth is valid
import datetime

## declare all variables used
correctDate = True
name = ""
starSign = ""
fortune = ""
birthYear = 0
birthMonth = 0
birthDay = 0

## introduce the program to the user
print("Hello! Nice to see you today! Welcome to our astrology program.")
## retrieve the users name
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

## while loop used to repeat prompting for birthYear, birthMonth, and birthDay until
## a valid date is entered. Also accounts for leap years becuase of year inclusion
while correctDate:
    ## prompts for birth date YYYY/MM/DD
    birthYear = int(input("Please enter the year of your birth in (YYYY) format (e.g. 1981):"))
    birthMonth = int(input("Please enter the month of your birth (1-12):"))
    birthDay = int(input("Please enter the day of your birth (1-31):"))

    ## try block that creates a new datetime object with the provided dates. If an exception is
    ##   thrown then we move to the except before changing the bool that affects our while statement
    try:
        newDate = datetime.datetime(birthYear, birthMonth, birthDay)

    ## Prints a message to the user telling them that they entered an invalid dates
    ## moves back to a new iteration of the while loop
    except ValueError:
        print("Be sure that you are entering a valid month and day. Please try again. ")


## nested if else statement that assigns star sign and fortune
## As a side note I found a list of fortune cookie fortunes and used them
##   as fortunes for the different star signs. The Lucky Numbers are all mine though
